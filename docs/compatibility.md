# Compatibility

Devices and games exercised during development of this project. This is **not** an exhaustive support matrix - unlisted titles may still work if they accept a DirectInput G920 or Fanatec DD1 identity with OEM FFB (`emuffb.dll`).

Update this page when you validate a new setup.

## Emulated identities

| Identity | VID:PID | OEM FFB | Notes |
|----------|---------|---------|--------|
| Logitech G920 (default) | `046D:C262` | `emuffb` + Logitech SDK pin on Start | Most validated games below |
| Fanatec DD1 | `0EB7:0004` | `emuffb` only (no Fanatec SDK, no Logitech SDK) | Physical Fanatec remains FFB/bind source; Gear R default **12** |

## Input devices tested

| Device | Role | Notes |
|--------|------|--------|
| DualSense (PS5) | Steering / buttons / axes source | Bound into virtual G920; no DualSense-side FFB |
| Fanatec Podium Wheel Base DD2 | FFB output (+ can be used as DI input) | Constant-force apply via shared InputHub acquire |
| Simucube | FFB output (+ can be used as DI input) | DI apply runs on a side thread so slower `SetParameters` does not stall input. |

## Wheel bases (FFB output)

Same DirectInput constant-force path for all of these:

| Device family | Status |
|---------------|--------|
| Fanatec (Podium / DD) | **Tested** (Podium Wheel Base DD2) |
| Simucube | **Tested** |
| Simagic | Designed for |
| Moza | Designed for |
| Thrustmaster / Logitech / generic DI FFB | Designed for |

## Games tested / compatible

| Game | Status | Input | FFB | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|-----|--------|
| Need for Speed Heat | **Tested** | Virtual G920 | OEM path used | Gears 1-6 = buttons 13-18. **Reverse: default button 19** (LGS / Driving Force Shifter). |
| Need for Speed Unbound | **Tested** | Virtual G920 | OEM path (multi-instance mixer + SHM v7) on Fanatec DD2 and Simucube | ConstantForce, Spring, Sine, Damper, Triangle. Gears 1-6 = 13-18. **Reverse: Bind Gear R → button 12**. Centering spring needs physical rim angle. **Controller Vibration must be On** (Accessibility → Controls) or race rumble magnitudes stay 0. |
| Forza Horizon 5 | **Tested** | **Fanatec DD1** (recommended) | OEM path on **Simucube** | Set **Emulated device → Fanatec DD1**. In Forza pick **any Fanatec profile**, then **custom bind** your layout. Virtual G920 works but Forza then uses a sparse G920-class FFB mix (grain on DDs). **Test signing off** to launch (see below). Leave **Debug** off for normal play. |
| Forza Horizon 6 | **Tested** | **Fanatec DD1** (recommended) | OEM path on **Simucube** | Same as FH5: Fanatec DD1 + any Fanatec in-game profile + custom binds. **Test signing off** to launch. Leave **Debug** off for normal play. |

### Forza Horizon — use Fanatec DD1

Forza picks effects and control layouts from the **wheel type it detects**. Steering + OEM FFB on the virtual Fanatec identity are the important parts; Forza can usually bind buttons (and handbrake) from your physical devices once you custom-bind.

1. In Steering Wheel Emulator (Stopped): **Emulated device → Fanatec DD1** → Start.
2. In Forza: select **any Fanatec wheel profile**, then use **custom bind** to map steering / pedals / buttons into a custom wheel profile.

The Fanatec bind list has **no virtual Handbrake / Dial axis** yet (no verified OEM face without DD1 hardware). That is not required for typical Forza setups. To contribute a physical OEM dump: **Debug Tools → Capture Fanatec OEM…**. Details: [user guide](user-guide.md#forza-horizon--use-fanatec-dd1) · [force-feedback.md](force-feedback.md#how-games-author-ffb-forza-vs-nfs-g920-vs-dd).

If you leave the emulator on virtual **G920**, Forza authors its **G920 OEM stream** (often stepped / low-rate Constant Force) instead of a Fanatec-class mix — that can feel grainy on DD bases. Prefer Fanatec DD1 for Forza.

### Forza Horizon series (test signing)

Forza Horizon games (confirmed on FH6) **do not launch while Windows test signing is on**. They exit at the splash screen (Steam exit code 100) - likely an integrity / anti-cheat check. OEM/SDK session pins are not the cause.

Test signing is only required to *install* the test-signed WinUHid driver. **Install WinUHid** turns test signing on temporarily, installs the driver, then turns it **off** again. After the final reboot, FH6 can launch and WinUHid usually keeps working. Secure Boot only needs to be off during that install - you can turn Secure Boot back on afterward. If test signing was left on: **Disable test signing** → reboot (no need to uninstall WinUHid).

### Gear R quick reference

| Game | Bind Gear R → G920 reverse button |
|------|-----------------------------------|
| NFS Heat (and most G920 titles) | **19** (default) |
| NFS Unbound | **12** |

See [user guide - H-pattern gears](user-guide.md#h-pattern-gears).

## Not validated yet

Add rows above when confirmed. Candidates often requested:

- Other EA / Codemasters titles with Logitech wheel profiles
- iRacing / ACC / AMS2 (typically stronger native wheel support; G920 path may still work)

## How to add a result

When you test something new, note:

1. Physical input device(s) and FFB base
2. Game + whether the virtual G920 appeared
3. Whether FFB moved the base
4. Optional: click **Debug**, reproduce briefly, **Stop debug** → **Export log…** (or expand **FFB debug** for live counters). Leave Debug off for normal play.
