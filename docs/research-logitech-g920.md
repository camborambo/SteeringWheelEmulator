# Research: Logitech G920, G HUB, and FFB

Notes from probing how G HUB exposes a real G920 and how NFS Unbound talks FFB to our virtual device (2026-10).

Raw probe dump also lives under `artifacts/lghub-probe/` (local; not required at runtime).

## How G HUB exposes a real G920

1. Package `g920` depends on `driver_usb`, `driver_hid_di_ffb`, `g920_dfu`.
2. `driver_hid_di_ffb` → `hid_driver_manager.exe` installs **`logi_joy_hid.inf`** into the driver store.
3. That INF binds:
   - `HID\VID_046D&PID_C262&Col01` → upper filters `logi_generic_hid_filter` + **`logi_joy_hid_filter`**
   - Friendly name: **Logitech G HUB G920 Driving Force Racing Wheel USB (HID)**
   - OEM registry via `G920Inst.AddReg` (`OEMData=43 00 08 10 12 00 00 00`, stock FFB CLSID `{62B43F0E-E7DB-4329-8C13-A966D84A289F}`)

## FFB ingress failure (HID++ writes = 0)

When Col01 is owned by **`logi_joy_hid_filter`**, Logitech’s HID++ FFB COM server talks to the filter via private IOCTLs. Those never become VHF `WriteReport` events, so emulator host-write counters stay at **0** even while Unbound “sees” a G920.

**Fix (current):**

- Advertise Hardware ID with **`&REV_9601`** so PnP does **not** match `logi_joy_hid.inf`.
- Do **not** `pnputil /install` `logi_joy_hid` for the virtual device.
- On Start, clean leftover no-REV Col01 nodes from older builds when needed.
- Point OEMForceFeedback at our **`emuffb.dll`** instead of Logitech’s CLSID.

Logitech’s `hidpp_forcefeedback` may still load but does not deliver usable WriteReports to WinUHid (`HidD_SetOutputReport` → `ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED`).

**FFB path now:** OEMForceFeedback CLSID → `emuffb.dll` (`IDirectInputEffectDriver`) → shared memory `Local\G920Emulator.FfbTorque.v7` → bridge → physical base.

| Change | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| Hardware ID → `HID\VID_046D&PID_C262&REV_9601` | Avoid Logitech filter auto-bind |
| Do not install `logi_joy_hid` on the virtual device | Filter swallows FFB |
| GetFeature / SetFeature / WriteReport hooks | Capture any residual host FFB paths |
| Host writes + OEM effect diagnostics | Distinguish “no traffic” vs “unparsed traffic” |

## Unbound / recognition

- Games that use DirectInput OEM (`OEMName` / `OEMData` / `OEMForceFeedback`) still resolve VID/PID → G920 profile without the Logitech filter.
- G HUB tile / “Logitech G HUB G920 … (HID)” friendly name may be absent (Microsoft HID-compliant name). Expected and preferable for FFB.
- G HUB showing G920 **Inactive** is expected for a WinUHid device - “Active” needs the real USB + HID++ handshake. Not required for DI FFB.

## Gear reverse button (per game)

Official **G920 + Driving Force Shifter** (Logitech LGS docs): gears **1-6 = buttons 13-18**, **Reverse = button 19**.

Games do **not** all use that reverse index in their native G920 profiles:

| Game | Gears 1-6 | Reverse | Emulator setting |
|------|-----------|---------|------------------|
| Most titles (e.g. **NFS Heat**) | 13-18 | **19** | Default - leave Bind Gear R on **19** |
| **NFS Unbound** | 13-18 | **12** | Bind Gear R → select **12 - NFS Unbound** |

Steering Wheel Emulator defaults to **19**. For Unbound, open **Gear R** binding and set **G920 reverse button** to **12** (saved on the profile; no bridge restart).

## Effect probe

`emuffb.dll` publishes SHM **v7** (`Local\G920Emulator.FfbTorque.v7`), including `TypesSeen` / `TypesPlaying` bitmasks and per-type mix torque. The emulator **FFB debug** UI and FFB Debug Overlay list each DirectInput type (same names as `emuffb-effects.log`) as seen or playing, with MIX totals. Full OEM log (`%TEMP%\emuffb-effects.log`) is written only while the status-bar **Debug** session is active.

### NFS Unbound (2026-10-04)

**Confirmed:** Accessibility → Controls → **Controller Vibration** must be **On**. With it Off, Unbound still creates CF / Damper / Triangle and enters the race FFB path, but every streamed magnitude stays **0** - only the centering Spring updates. That looks like “emulator/base not forwarding rumble” when the game simply never sent it. Fanatec vs Simucube captures matched once Vibration was on.

Unbound streams these DirectInput OEM types (all must stay in the mix - do not mute/disable any):

| Type | Role |
|------|------|
| **ConstantForce** | Road / steering forces (mag often 0 when idle, then signed updates) |
| **Spring** | Arcade return-to-center (static ~10000 + dynamic slot) |
| **Damper** | Damping while driving (often coeff ~2500) |
| **Sine** | Rumble / impacts |
| **Triangle** | Continuous surface / vibration stream |
| **Square** | Impacts / collisions |

Universal native mixing of **all** DI effect types is required. Hardware `DIPROP_AUTOCENTER` must not be toggled during gameplay (it fights the OEM mix on Fanatec); use FFB debug **Center** only for a manual return-to-center test.

## Fanatec DD1 virtual identity

Optional toolbar identity (not a second FFB stack):

| Item | Detail |
|------|--------|
| VID:PID | `0EB7:0004` (Fanatec PC Compatibility) |
| WinUHid REV | `REV_E001` (keep-visible / identity fix) |
| OEM FFB | Same **`emuffb.dll`** CLSID as G920 |
| Not used | Fanatec SDK / FAW; Logitech Steering Wheel SDK pin; Fanatec DD1 PC `0006` |
| Physical base | Still your real Fanatec/Simucube/etc. for motor output and binding |
| Handbrake / Dial | Not in the Fanatec bind list or HID yet — no verified OEM face without DD1 hardware. Forza mainly needs wheel identity + FFB; buttons/handbrake bind from physical devices. Capture: **Debug Tools → Capture Fanatec OEM…** |

Use when a title prefers a Fanatec-class device. Gear R defaults to **12**. Details: [architecture.md](architecture.md), [user-guide.md](user-guide.md#emulated-device) · [Forza steps](user-guide.md#forza-horizon--use-fanatec-dd1).
